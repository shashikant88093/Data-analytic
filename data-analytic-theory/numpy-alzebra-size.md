# Numpy , Algebra and Size ?

- **Numpy** is a powerful library in Python for numerical computing, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is often used as a foundational library that underpins many other libraries, such as pandas and scikit-learn.
  
- **Algebra** in the context of Numpy refers to the mathematical operations that can be performed on these arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Numpy provides efficient implementations of these operations, allowing for fast computations on large datasets.
  
- **Size** in Numpy refers to the dimensions of the arrays and matrices, which can be manipulated using various functions. The size of an array can affect the performance of operations, as larger arrays may require more memory and processing power. Numpy provides tools to efficiently handle arrays of different sizes and shapes, enabling users to perform complex calculations with ease.
